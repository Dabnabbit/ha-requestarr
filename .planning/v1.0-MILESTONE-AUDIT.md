**Satisfied:** 28/30 | **Partial:** 2/30 | **Unsatisfied:** 0/30

## E2E Flow Status

| Flow | Status |
|------|--------|
| 1. Install via config flow (3-step wizard) | Complete |
| 2. Sensor creation and 5-min polling | Complete |
| 3. Movie search and request | Complete |
| 4. TV search and request | Complete |
| 5. Music search and request | Complete |
| 6. Card editor saves config | Partial — config saves but tab toggles have no effect |

## Integration Findings

### Partial: Card editor tab toggles (CARD-05)
`RequestarrCardEditor` renders `show_radarr`/`show_sonarr`/`show_lidarr` checkboxes and saves them via `config-changed`, but `RequestarrCard._renderTabs()` always renders all three tabs unconditionally. The toggles have no runtime effect.

**Fix:** Add conditional guards in `_renderTabs()` to hide tabs when `this.config.show_X === false`.

### Advisory: iot_class mismatch (SCAF-01)
`manifest.json` declares `iot_class: cloud_polling` but arr services are local-network. Should be `local_polling`.

### Advisory: No pytest CI job (DIST-03)
18 tests pass locally but `validate.yml` only runs hassfest + hacs/action. No GitHub Actions job invokes pytest.

### Advisory: Orphan binary_sensor entity (SCAF-02)
`binary_sensor.py` creates an undocumented `TemplateStatusSensor` that duplicates status info already in `RequestarrSensor`. Not harmful but adds clutter.

## Tech Debt Summary

| Phase | Item | Severity |
|-------|------|----------|
| Phase 1 | Missing VERIFICATION.md (never formally verified) | Low |
| Phase 5 | show_* config toggles not wired to card render | Medium |
| Template | iot_class should be local_polling | Low |
| Template | No pytest job in CI workflow | Medium |
| Phase 5 | Orphan binary_sensor entity | Low |

**Total: 5 items across 3 phases + template**
